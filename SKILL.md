# Factor Ranking SAGE

Use this skill to rank local quantitative factors with exactly one standard method per run. Keep factor generation, model hyperparameter optimization, portfolio construction, and final trading validation outside this skill.

## Core Workflow

1. Read references/input_schema.md before preparing the input JSON.
2. Provide local factor and label CSV files with one unique row per (date, ticker) observation.
3. Configure one fixed train/validation split and an embargo suitable for the label horizon.
4. Choose one mode:
   - Use mode=mrmr for deterministic regression F-statistic relevance and Pearson-redundancy Top-K selection on training rows.
   - Use mode=sage for fixed-model Marginal-SAGE MSE contribution. Choose model.type=lgbm or model.type=mlp.
5. Run the matching smoke configuration first:

~~~bash
python scripts/run_factor_selection.py --input examples/factor_selection_mrmr_smoke.json
python scripts/run_factor_selection.py --input examples/factor_selection_lgbm_smoke.json
python scripts/run_factor_selection.py --input examples/factor_selection_mlp_smoke.json
~~~

6. Run the user's JSON through the same CLI:

~~~bash
python scripts/run_factor_selection.py --input <input-json>
~~~

7. Read references/output_contract.md before consuming selected_factors.json, the method-specific ranking CSV, and selection_report.md.
8. Keep a locked holdout outside the selection run and independently compare the selected subset with full-factor and random-subset baselines.

## Method Boundaries

- Run mRMR and SAGE independently. Do not combine their scores.
- In mRMR mode, use training rows only. The validation rows are retained for split consistency but are not used by the selector.
- In SAGE mode, fit one configured model on training rows and explain sampled validation loss with the local empirical MarginalImputer and permutation estimator.
- Treat SAGE convergence metadata and standard errors as required diagnostics, not optional details.
- Treat every Top-K result as a ranking candidate. Neither mRMR nor SAGE proves that K is optimal or that a retrained subset will improve out-of-sample LGBM/MLP performance.
- Do not add native model importance, SHAP, permutation importance, drop-one, retraining coalitions, backward pruning, add-back, custom combined scores, or portfolio logic to this skill.

## Output Contract

Write each run under output_root/runs/<run_id>/ with common manifests, a selected-factor JSON, a report, and mode-specific artifacts:

- mRMR: mrmr_ranking.csv and mrmr_redundancy_matrix.csv
- SAGE: sage_values.csv and sage_metadata.json

## References

- Use references/source_boundary.md for data, algorithm, and research boundaries.
- Use references/input_schema.md for input fields and mode-specific configuration.
- Use references/output_contract.md for artifact names and result fields.
- Use references/metric_definitions.md to interpret mRMR and SAGE values.
- Use references/validation_notes.md before assigning research meaning to a ranking.
- Use references/algorithm_sources.md for upstream algorithm provenance and notices.
