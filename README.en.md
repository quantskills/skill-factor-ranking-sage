# skill-factor-ranking-sage

**English** | [简体中文](README.md)

> A Codex / QUANTSKILLS factor-selection skill that ranks local quantitative factors with deterministic regression mRMR or fixed-model Marginal-SAGE and writes auditable Top-K artifacts.

This community project is not official certification, investment advice, or production trading validation.

## What It Does

The repository packages two independent factor-ranking methods behind one local JSON CLI:

- **mRMR** uses univariate regression F-statistic relevance, absolute Pearson redundancy, and greedy quotient selection.
- **Marginal-SAGE** fits one LGBM or MLP model and estimates global validation MSE contribution with empirical marginal imputation and random factor permutations.

Both methods use the same JSON configuration workflow and command-line entry point, with inspectable ranking artifacts and run records.

## What It Does Not Do

The skill does not generate factors, tune model hyperparameters, choose an optimal K, run SHAP or permutation importance, perform retraining coalitions or drop-one selection, construct portfolios, or run a production backtest.

A Top-K ranking is a research candidate. It is not proof that a retrained subset improves holdout model or trading performance.

## Quick Start

~~~bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python scripts/run_factor_selection.py --input examples/factor_selection_mrmr_smoke.json
python scripts/run_factor_selection.py --input examples/factor_selection_lgbm_smoke.json
python scripts/run_factor_selection.py --input examples/factor_selection_mlp_smoke.json
~~~

Run a custom JSON configuration:

~~~bash
python scripts/run_factor_selection.py --input <input-json>
~~~

## Input

Provide local factor and label CSV files with unique (date, ticker) rows. Factor columns must be numeric. Configure one fixed train/validation split and an embargo that matches the overlapping label horizon.

The bundled toy CSV files are synthetic data constructed for smoke tests. They do not represent real securities, market data, or accounts.

- mRMR uses training rows only.
- SAGE fits on training rows and estimates contribution on sampled validation rows.
- available_date is optional. When it is absent, the runtime reports point-in-time risk instead of claiming that the inputs are leakage-free.

See references/input_schema.md for the full JSON contract.

## Outputs

Each run writes output_root/runs/<run_id>/ with selected_factors.json, selection_report.md, resolved_config.json, input_manifest.json, and run_manifest.json.

mRMR also writes mrmr_ranking.csv and mrmr_redundancy_matrix.csv. SAGE also writes sage_values.csv and sage_metadata.json.

Read references/output_contract.md and references/metric_definitions.md before consuming results.

## Validation and Interpretation

- mRMR relevance and redundancy do not optimize retrained LGBM/MLP holdout performance.
- SAGE values explain fixed-model average MSE contribution and do not solve the best-size-K retraining problem.
- Inspect sage_std, converged, and convergence_ratio before interpreting a SAGE ordering.
- Validate Top-K on a locked holdout against the full factor set and multiple random Top-K baselines.

The current runnable validation scope covers smoke workflows, method behavior, convergence diagnostics, and output contracts. It does not claim positive out-of-sample RankIC, MSE improvement, portfolio returns, or trading performance.
